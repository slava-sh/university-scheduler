# Solution for [VK Cup 2017 Wild Card Round 2](http://codeforces.com/contest/775/standings)

I tried variations of simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, and greedy search.
The last worked the best.

Sadly, I chose the safety margin to be just 50 ms, and my solution exceeded the time limit on 10 of 320 final tests.
It only earned 31354.946 points, placing me 61st out of 98 teams.
